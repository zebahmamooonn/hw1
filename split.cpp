CSCI 104: Homework 1 Problem 1

Write a recursive function to split a sorted singly-linked
list into two sorted linked lists, where one has the even 
numbers and the other contains the odd numbers. Students 
will receive no credit for non-recursive solutions. 
To test your program write a separate .cpp file and #include
split.h.  **Do NOT add main() to this file**.  When you submit
the function below should be the only one in this file.
